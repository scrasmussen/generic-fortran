Introduction
------------

Various mechanisms for generic programming in Fortran have been
proposed over the years.  This paper explores some of the strengths
and weaknesses of the two most complete proposals, intelligent macros
(J3/03-264r1) and parameterized modules (J3/06-123) for use in a
nontrivial use case: generic containers (J3/18-110r1).  Some comments
are also made with regard to the approach in J3/18-281r1
("templated procedures"), but that proposal is too inncomplete at
this time for a comparable analysis.  Finally, this paper also
contrasts these approaches against existing practice of leveraging
cpp/fpp to provide generic containers.


Generic mechanisms
------------------

1. gFTL (https://github.com/Goddard-Fortran-Ecosystem/gFTL)

gFTL is an existing framework for instantiating Fortran containers.
It leverages the conventional cpp/fpp preprocessor and provides robust
implementations for Vector, Set, and Map containers that are very
similar to the same-named containers from the C++ standard template
library (STL).  While this approach is not standard comforming it only
relies on features that are available through essentially all modern
Fortran compilers.  For this paper a stripped-down gFTL-like package
was created that contains the essential aspects and simplifies the
creation of similar implementations from the other proposed container
mechanisms

2. Intelligent macros (J3/06-123)

As the name suggests this facility, if adopted, provides relatively
simple mechanisms where by users can define and expand macros that
produce Fortran statements.  User-defined macros have named arguments
with the actual arguments consisting of a sequence of one or more
tokens.  Special forms are provided for looping (MACRO DO) and
specialization (MACRO IF).

3. Parameterized modules (J3/03-264r1)

This facility is modeled after analogous capabilities in Ada.
Parameterized modules have one or more template parameters that can be
types (as well as other things like integers).  Instantiation of a
parameterized module acts as though a module-like entity exists that
corresponds to the actual template parameters.



Containers
----------

Software containers are convenient abstractions that allow client code
to manage a collection of same-typed entities with a consistent set of
interfaces including the ability to iterate over the elements of the
collection.  Fortran arrays are a powerful form of container.  This
paper explores the implementation of a generic Map container.  Such
containers are also known as associative arrays and hashes and manage
a collection of key-value pairs where all keys are of some fixed type
and all values are of some (generally different) fixed type.  Values
can be retrieved from the Map by specifying a key.  In general, keys
can be any type that can be ordered.  And values can be of any type.

This particular design for Map leverages a Set container. which manages
a collection of entities of type Pair where Pair has 2 components: a
key and value.   Internally, Set is implemented as a binary tree.

The Set container (or rather the underlying tree structure) is in turn
implemented by leveraging two types of Vector containers.  A Vector
(or List) container is the simplest container considered here and and
can be thought of as managing a growable array of entities of a given
type.  Integer Vectors are used for managing mapping nodes of the tree
and a Pair Vector is used to contain the node values.  (Pointers would
possibly be the more natural way to implement such a tree, but are not
used here for technical reasons related to implcations for further
subclassing and an unresolved interpretation request for FINAL
methods.)


A zipped diretory tree is included ith this paper.  The directory tree
includes representative implementations of the generic Map container
using the 3 generic mechanisms described above.  Each also has an
example driver program that insntantiates a sparse Integer-Real Map.
None of these implementations fully functioning, but should be
reasonably indicative of what a correct implemention would look like.
The FPP version does at least compile and if time permits before I
submit this paper may even successfully run the demo.


Section 3.  Observations

A. Containers use case

Implementation of containers was relatively straightforward for both
parameterized modules and macros.  Superficially the structures are
quite similar and in particular the actual code for using an
instantiated Map was quite similar.  However, the implementation using
parameterized modules was considerably simpler for two important
reasons.

1. In both the intelligent macros and the cpp/fpp approaches, most
   macros were required to be split into two separate macros so that
   type declaration could go before module CONTAINS and type-bound
   prodecures go after the module CONTAINS.  This would not be an
   issue for very simple scenarious but if one desires the macros to
   be composable, most use cases would run afoul of this issue.

2. Macros required some amount of manual name mangling to avoid
   namespace conflicts.  E.g., the Set container uses two different
   types of vector containes (contained objects and indexing) which
   otherwise have the same type-bound procedure names.  To bring both
   types into the Set implementation some renaming (via "=>" )was
   necessary for each type-bound procedure declaration.  Parameterized
   modules on the other hand very nicely instantiate each of the two
   vector classes and only require a rename of the types while the
   type-bound procedures remain private and only accessible through
   the type.

As noted in the introduction, the templated procedures proposal
description was insufficient to implement this use case without
additional features.  Broadly one would expect to put all of the class
methods into module that implements them as TEMPLATE functions and
TEMPLATE subroutines.  However, without a mechanism to parameterize
the types themselves, the user must then explicitly declare each
instantiated type with all of the type-bound procedures.  However,
some aspects of such an implementation are still not possible without
additional work:

* Factory methods.  Each container type (Vector, Set, Map) has factory
  methods begin() and end() which return an iterator type.  Each
  instantiation of a container has a dual iterator type that must be
  instantiated.  However, parameterized procedures provide no
  mechanism for returning an item of a type that is derived in such a
  manner.

* No specific mechanism was provided for declaring polymorphic dummy
  arguments that are required for the passed argument dummy of
  type-bound procedures.  A less seriousconcern that nonetheless needs
  to be addressed.  Discussing with the author it was suggested that
  the GENERIC TYPE mechanism could be used.  Presumably this would
  look something like:


      INTEGER FUNCTION size(this)
         GENERIC TYPE(T) => TYPE(this)
         CLASS (T), INTENT(IN) :: this
      END INTEGER FUNCTION
      

Ultimately the more fundamental issue is simply that, at least for the
containers use case, the mechanism is simply not friendly to object
oriented features.  Methods are defined in modules separately from the
types that they are bound to and users are left desiring yet another
templating mechanism for their types.  This is possibly reparable, but
a natural/unique solution is not readily apparent.


B. Other observations about strengths and weaknesses

While the use case analyis above highly favored parameterized modules
over intelligent macros, other scenarios would likely motivate
coopting at least some of the intelligent macros capabilities.

For instance, the simplified container use case did not require any
template specializations, but many real-world use cases would.  In
particular, if the container use case was extended to consider
containers of deferred length strings, one would be confronted with
the need to declare string variables in two different ways at
different points of the implementation.  Dummy arguments for objects
passed into the container would be declared as

     CHARACTER(*), ...

while returned pointers to contained objects would be declared as

     CHARACTER(:), ...

In theory, one could have a separate template for this special issue,
but it would result in considerable duplication.  Another relatively
obvious use case that would demand specialization capabilities, would
be a matrix utility that supports numeric types.  Such a facility
might offer additional methods for floating-point types than for
integers.

Another (fixable) deficiency in the parameterized modules approach
that would be exposed in other common use cases is the need to be able
to "loop" over a set of template parameters.  E.g. a designer might
wish to overload an interface for multiple types:

     INTERFACE FOO
         MODULE PROCEDURE FOO_INTEGER
         MODULE PROCEDURE FOO_REAL
         MODULE PROCEDURE FOO_DOUBLE
         ...
      END INTERFACE FOO

and then generate an instantiation for each case.  Without some
mechanism to loop over a list of template parameters such use cases
will not be well-supported even by parameterized modules.

One final observation of a desirable feature that is missing from the
parameterized module paper would be some way to restrict the TYPE
template parameters to be from some specific set of TYPE's.  E.g. only
allow extensions of a base type, or from a list of specified types.  A
common use case could be to restrict a TYPE parameter to be NUMERIC.
